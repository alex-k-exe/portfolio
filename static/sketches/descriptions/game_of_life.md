## Game of Life

Modelled after [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

It is a cellular automata simulator: each frame, every living "cell" in the grid keeps living or dies based on how many of its neighbours are living, and dead cells can be born
Living cells are black
