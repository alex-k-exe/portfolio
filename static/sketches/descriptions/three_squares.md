# Three squares
It's my personal favourite because of how simple it is
It is quite laggy though

- Each coloured square is an xy coordinate
- It is given a HSV colour value based on the average distance from it to the three black squares

## Controls
- Click a black square to select it
- Then click somewhere else to move that black square
- Or click it again to deselect it
